WARNING: Your extension is using a temporary extension_identifier unsuitable

every version of your extension so installing later version of the extension
replaces the old version.

While the temporary extension identifier generated will not change as long as
you do not change the name of the extension and are generating the extension on
this particular Mac, you should use the extension_identifier parameter to set a
unique identifier in perpetuity in case you ever want to generate the extension

=head1 NAME

Mac::PopClip::Quick - quickly write PopClip extensions in Perl

=for test_synopsis BEGIN { die "SKIP: not testable\n"; }

=head1 SYNOPSIS

First write a script:

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   use 5.012;
   use warnings;
   use autodie;

   use Mac::PopClip::Quick;
   use POSIX qw(strftime);

   open my $fh, ''>>:utf8', "$ENV{HOME}/Dropbox/runlog.txt";
   say $fh strftime("%FT%T",gmtime) . ' ' . popclip_text();

Then install it as a PopClip Extension

   bash$ INSTALL_POPCLIP_EXTENSION=1 ./runlog.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PopClip For Mac is a commercial OS X utility from Pilotmoon Software that
creates little popup menus when you highlight text.  Please see
L<http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/> for more details.

This module make it easier to write PopClip extensions in Perl.  With this
module you can turn a simple Perl script into an installable extension with a
single command.

The resulting extension does not depend on the Mac::PopClip::Quick module, and
can be safely distributed to systems that do not have this module installed.

=head2 Examples

In your script you should C<use Mac::PopClip::Quick>.

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Mac::PopClip::Quick;
    system('say',"The selected text is '.popclip_text());

From the command line you simply need to execute the script with the
C<INSTALL_POPCLIP_EXTENSION> environment variable set to a true value.

   bash$ INSTALL_POPCLIP_EXTENSION=1 ./reverse.pl

You can also create an executable suitable for distribution using the

   bash$ CREATE_POPCLIP_EXTENSION=1 ./reverse.pl

Options can be set by passing them in the C<use> statement:

  use Mac::PopQuick::Quick (
      extension_identifier => 'com.yourdomain.extensionname',
  );

They'll be passed through to the underlying L<Mac::PopClip::Quick::Generator>
class's constructor.

You can use C<after_action> to control what your extension does with the
script output, for example pasting it:

    use Mac::PopQuick::Quick (
        extension_name => 'Reverse Text',
        after_action => 'paste-result',
    );
    print reverse popclip_text();

=head1 Supported Options

=head2 Core Options

=head3 extension_name

The name of the extension.  By default this is the name of the script, minus
any file extension (e.g. if your script if called C<foo.pl> then the extension
will be called C<foo> by default.)

=head3 title

The title.  By default, the same as the C<extension_name>.

=head3 filename

The filename that the tarball will be created with.  Should end with
C<.popclipextz> (though we don't force you to.)

By default a temporary filename is used if no value is provided.  If the
C<CREATE_POPCLIP_EXTENSION> environment variable is set then this will be
printed out.

=head3 extension_identifier

A unique identifier for your extension.  This enables PopClip to identify
if an extension it's installing should install as a new extension or replace
an older version of the same extension.

By default this will generate something unique for you by using the unique ID of
your Mac and the extension name.  This is B<not> suitable for distribution (if
you change hardware you won't be able to use it anymore) and you should set a
value for this attribute before distributing your extension.

=head2 Options Controlling PopClip Behavior

=head3 required_software_version

The required version of PopClip.  By default this is 701.

=head3 regex

A string containing the regex that controls when the extension will be
triggered.  Note that this is not a Perl regex, but rather a string that PopClip
can execute as a PCRE.

By default this is undefined, meaning no regex is used.

=head3 script_interpreter

The program you want to use to execute your Perl script (it can be handy to set
this if you want to use a perl other than the system perl, e.g. a perl you
installed with perlbrew)

By default this is C</usr/bin/perl>, the system perl.

=head3 blocked_apps

Array of bundle identifier strings (e.g. C<com.apple.TextEdit>) of applications
for which this extension's actions should not appear.

=head3 required_apps

Array of bundle identifier strings of applications (e.g. C<com.apple.TextEdit>)
that this extension's actions will appear in.

=head1 COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

This software is copyright (c) 2016 by Mark Fowler.

This is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
same terms as the Perl 5 programming language system itself.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Just the one:

=head2 popclip_text

Exported by default, this function simply returns the value of
C<%ENV{POPCLIP_TEXT}> (but gives better error messages if you mistype it and
have use strict turned on.)

Since the Perl source code that is bundled in the generated extension is
modified so it no longer loads this module (so that if you distribute your
extension then your end users do not have to install this module) the code
for this function will be directly inserted into the modified source code.

This function is defined with an empty prototype, meaning you can call it
without having to use parentheses.

=head1 BUGS

Several features of PopClip aren't yet supported.

Installing this extension leaves a copy of it (unavoidably, because there's
no way to tell when PopClip is done with the file) in the temp directory.

If your code has Perl's subroutine signatures feature enabled at the time you
import this module then the modified code will not properly define the prototype
for the C<popclip_text> function meaning you will be unable to call it without
parentheses.
